                    <p class="large text-muted">More than 40 years I have been involved in legal, economic, regulatory, organizational as well as personnel issues and, since 1991 I have had always management responsibilities. I was lucky to meet many interesting personalities and to develop and implement solutions for many international families. Succession Planning, Asset Protection and Tax Planning have been in the focus of my activities but also aspects of corporate and family governance were of great importance. And, in the last 8 years I could gain significant experience in the prevention of money laundering and the supervision of financial intermediaries. My Expertise in management, personnel development  as well as organizational development were ale extremely useful in the last stage of my career.
                        This collection of material expertise can be of great value for individuals, families, corporates and entities of the public sector to find solutions for actual challenges. Find it out!
